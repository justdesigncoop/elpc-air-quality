            <p style="padding: 1em 0em 0em">The <a href="http://elpc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Law & Policy Center</a> (ELPC) and <a href="{% url 'partners' %}">community partners</a> have long been interested in air pollution-related public health issues and their disproportionate effects across Chicago’s neighborhoods. Our goal is improving air quality in the areas most threatened by PM2.5 pollution.</p>
             
            <p>Chicago is a major transportation and economic hub with high concentrations of trains, trucks, and heavy construction equipment. Many of these vehicles pollute the air with harmful particulates (PM2.5) within and around the highways, corridors, rail yards, intermodal facilities, and construction sites where they operate.</p>
             
            <p>Chicago also has very high children’s asthma rates, with some neighborhoods seeing one in every three children affected. Asthma hospitalization rates in Chicago are twice the national rate. COPD and other respiratory illnesses and heart problems are also rampant.<sup><a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/CDPH/CDPHComHlthStatMiniDataFINAL4172015.pdf" title="Hospital Discharge Data, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2011.

            <h2>Understanding PM2.5</h2>
            <p style="padding: 1em 0em 0em">Particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) is a highly toxic air contaminant composed of a mixture of fine carbon soot particles and gases from a variety of sources such as power plants, idling motor vehicles, construction sites, airplanes, wood burning, fires, and dust.<sup><a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=19" title="&quot;Particulate Matter Emissions.&quot; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Report on the Environment. Web. 9 April 2018." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>
             
            <p>PM2.5 can affect multiple systems in the human body because they penetrate the body’s natural defenses and can become lodged in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. This can lead to a wide variety of health problems including:  coughs, headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, aggravated allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other serious illnesses.<sup><a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/air/health-effects-diesel-exhaust" title="Monserrat, Laurie. &quot;Health Effects of Diesel Exhaust.&quot; OEHHA.

            <p>The <a href="https://airnow.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) classifies levels of PM2.5 with a scale of colors and terms that help to signal to people whether they should be concerned about the local air:</p>

            <p>While long term exposure to PM2.5 can affect everyone, children and the elderly are particularly sensitive to the negative health effects caused by air pollution. Children are at an increased risk of asthma and other illnesses after exposure to PM2.5 because their lungs are still developing. Increased respiration during prolonged outdoor activity also contributes to higher PM2.5 intake.<sup><a href="#" onClick="return false;" title="The Effects of Air Pollution on the Health of Children" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Buka, Irena, Samuel Koranteng, and Alvaro R Osornio-Vargas.

            <p>New <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">handheld particulate monitoring</a> technology is easy to use and generates transparent, <a href="http://aircasting.org/map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly-available</a> information. These allow ELPC and our community partners to launch efforts to advocate for cleaner practices and equipment at construction sites, inform traffic management patterns, influence public transportation operations, enforce local anti-idling ordinances, and allow residents to make better-informed decisions to limit their exposure to particulate matter pollution. </p>
