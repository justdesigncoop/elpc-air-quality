            <p>The <a href="http://elpc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Law & Policy Center </a> (ELPC) is a public interest environmental legal advocacy and eco-business innovation organization. One of ELPC's area of focus is on lowering exposure to airborne particulate matter pollution that can pose a serious threat to respiratory health. Due to lack of public information on neighborhood-level particulate matter levels, our Air Quality Program brings Chicago residents from areas at high risk for poor air quality to the table to gather and understand data and discuss ways to improve air quality and health. </p>
			<p>Since 2017, ELPC alongside our community partners and volunteers have been systematically collecting particulate matter data around Chicago neighborhoods and business corridors using handheld <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> AirBeam</a> monitors. This video illustrates our  monitoring progress while showing the percent of unhealthy monitor readings we have encountered thus far. The more red the color, the higher the percent of unhealthy measurements in that area. The HEIGHT of the data illustrates the number of measurements collected in that area. So, the TALLER, redder columns are where we can say with some certainty that air quality is poor.</p>
